# **App Name**: Press Shop Optimizer

## Core Features:

- Part Data Input: Capture constant part data: process flow (tool name), lowest press, die setting time, and time for producing 50 pieces.
- Daily Data Entry: Daily data input: priorities, quantity to be produced (with ranges), machine availability, and actual production.
- Machine Downtime: Machine availability input, allowing for entry of downtime of machines.
- Production Planning: Generate a production plan showing the ideal quantity that can be produced for each part, informed by the priority, quantity range, and machine availability; takes into account whether the machine will become free soon; decides to suggest higher capacity machine for a part when approporiate; uses machine capacity to select best available resource. Incorporates historical data on production times for similar operations to optimize schedule. Can use multiple simulated scenarios. Uses an AI tool.
- Time-Based Plan: Display a time-based plan showing which part will be produced on which machine at what time, visualized in a table format, as illustrated. Machine names listed down the side, time split into intervals across the top.  Cells show 'part number - operation name - quantity' for a specified period.
- Discrepancy Highlighting: Highlight discrepancies between planned and actual production.
- Process Flow Management: Automatically manage the flow of parts from one process to the next, giving priority to higher-priority parts, including the automated reassignment to an appropriate higher-capacity machine when the ideal machine is occupied.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) / RGB(#3399FF), a bright, saturated blue to evoke efficiency and clarity.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) / RGB(#F0F8FF), a very light blue to provide a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) / RGB(#33A6A6), a contrasting cyan to highlight important information and actions.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a modern and readable interface.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different machines and part processes.
- A tabular layout for the time-based plan, as shown in the sample output, with clear headings and color-coded cells for easy readability.
- Use subtle animations to highlight changes in production status and discrepancies, drawing the user's attention without being distracting.
